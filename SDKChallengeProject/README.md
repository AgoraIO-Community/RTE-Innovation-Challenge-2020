# RTE Programming Challenge 2020

*English* | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Introduction

The RTE 2020 Innovation Challenge is a Data Algorithms and Innovative Applications Challenge launched by Agora and the RTC developer community，for developers all around the world.

Our original goal is to find out the developers who are interested in the technology boundaries of RTC, who love technology innovation, and who want to challenge themselves.

There are two different tracks of the challenge, the Super Resolution Image Quality Algorithm Challenge, and the Programming Challenge, where developers are free to sign up.

We hope that the contestants will solve practical problems in academic, commercial, and social areas while pursuing technological innovation and performance, and use technology to create greater value for society.

The RTC Programming Challenge is an online hackathon for RTC developers, programming enthusiasts and geeks worldwide.

This Challenge will be held in the form of "Online Programming, Online Submissions, and Online Finals". We hope that the contestants will solve the practical problems in academic, commercial, and social areas while pursuing technological innovation, and use technology to create greater value for society.

## Challenge - Develop Application with Agora SDK

RTC technology has been widely used in real-time interactive scenarios such as video conferencing, online education, video conferencing, online medical, etc. In the context of the global epidemic, it has accelerated the birth of new scenes such as cloud dancing, cloud gathering sings. And we believe RTC technology can do much more than that.

This fall competition, in addition to the original SDK published on the official website of Agora, we will also provide more scene combination capabilities with the Special Version SDK, you can also combine with Go Pro and other hardware, to build more interesting scenes. Since the Special Version SDK is more complex to develop, so we'll give the corresponding work a certain amount of extra points.
